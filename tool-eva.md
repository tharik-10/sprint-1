## Purpose
The purpose of this document is to evaluate and compare popular GitOps tools to help organizations automate and streamline their application deployment and infrastructure management. It provides a clear overview of the key tools available, compares their features, and assists teams in selecting the most suitable GitOps solution for their needs. The document aims to aid decision-making and improve the adoption of GitOps practices for efficient and automated continuous delivery.

## Introduction 
GitOps is a modern deployment approach that uses Git as the single source of truth for infrastructure and application configurations. It enables automated, consistent, and auditable deployments by applying changes through Git commits, improving delivery speed, collaboration, and reliability.

## What is GitOps ?
GitOps is a DevOps practice that uses Git repositories as the source of truth for managing infrastructure and application deployments. It relies on declarative configuration (like YAML files) stored in Git, and automated agents (e.g., Argo CD, Flux) to continuously reconcile the actual state in Kubernetes with the desired state defined in Git.For detailed understanding GitOps refer to this repository [link](https://github.com/Cloud-NInja-snaatak/Documentation/blob/Shubham-SCRUM-99/vcs_design/gitops/understanding.md)

## Why GitOps ?
| **Reason**                     | **Description**                                                                                       |
|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Automated Deployment**        | GitOps eliminates manual deployment steps and automates deployment pipelines using Git.                |
| **Consistency and Reproducibility** | Since all configurations are versioned in Git, deployments are reproducible, ensuring consistent environments. |
| **Auditability and Traceability** | Git provides a full audit trail of changes, ensuring that teams can trace issues back to specific commits. |
| **Reduced Complexity**          | GitOps simplifies the workflow by using familiar tools (e.g., Git, CI/CD) to manage deployments.        |
| **Improved Developer Experience** | Developers can use Git to manage infrastructure as code, improving collaboration and velocity.         |
