## Introduction

This document provides a concise reference for understanding and using PostgreSQL within the OT-MICROSERVICES architecture. It explains its purpose, core features, setup requirements, and dependenciesâ€”specifically focusing on its role in services like attendance-api. It is intended for developers, DevOps engineers, and system administrators working on microservices that require relational data storage.

## What is PostgreSQL ?

**PostgreSQL** (often abbreviated as **Postgres**) is a powerful, open-source object-relational database system. It is known for its reliability, feature robustness, and standards compliance. Originally developed at the University of California, Berkeley, PostgreSQL has over 30 years of active development and a proven architecture.

## Why Use PostgreSQL ?

- **Open Source & Free**: No licensing fees, strong community support.
- **Advanced Features**: Supports complex queries, JSON, indexing (GIN, GiST, BRIN), and ACID compliance.
- **Extensible**: Custom data types, operators, and powerful extensions like PostGIS.
- **Secure & Stable**: SSL, advanced authentication, and strong data integrity.
- **Scalable**: Handles large datasets and high concurrency with ease.
- **Cross-Platform**: Compatible with Linux, Windows, macOS, and more.

## Key Features

- ACID-compliant transactions.
- JSON and JSONB support (used in dynamic payloads).
- Strong indexing and query optimization (used in filtering and reporting attendance data).
- Role-based access control.
- Extensible with user-defined types and functions.
- Supports concurrent users with MVCC (Multi-Version Concurrency Control).

| Port | Description                       |
|------|-----------------------------------|
| 5432 | Default PostgreSQL connection port |

## Dependencies

### Run-time Dependencies

- `libreadline`:	Allows command-line editing (for tools like psql)
- `openssl`: For secure SSL communication

### Build-time Dependencies

- `gcc`: GNU Compiler Collection
- `make`: Build automation tool.For more details about `make` refer to this repository [link](https://github.com/Cloud-NInja-snaatak/Documentation/blob/aditya_scrum40/commonstack/dependencies/make/documentation.md)
- `zlib`: Compression library.(for compressing/decompressing data in backups etc.)

## PostgreSQL Use Case in `attendance-api`

In the `OT-MICROSERVICES/attendance-api` project, PostgreSQL is used as the primary database to:

- Store employee attendance data (check-in, check-out, status).
- Enable API operations like creating, updating, and retrieving attendance records.
- Ensure reliable and structured storage using SQLAlchemy ORM.
- Support date/time queries and filtering for reports.

The connection is defined in `app.py`, and data models (like Attendance) are mapped to PostgreSQL tables in `models/attendance.py`.

## Key Concepts of PostgreSQL

| Concept               | Description |
|------------------------|-------------|
| Database               | A collection of schemas, tables, and related objects. |
| Schema                 | A namespace that contains named database objects like tables, views, etc. |
| Table                  | A collection of rows organized into columns, used to store structured data. |
| Row                   | A single record inside a table, made up of multiple column values. |
| Column                 | A single field of data within a table; defines data type and constraints. |
| Primary Key            | A column (or set of columns) that uniquely identifies each row in a table. |
| Foreign Key            | A column that establishes a relationship between two tables. |
| Index                  | Improves query performance by allowing faster data retrieval. |
| View                   | A virtual table based on a SQL query; used to simplify complex queries. |
| Transaction            | A sequence of operations performed as a single logical unit of work (ACID properties). |
| Role                   | Represents a database user or a group of users with specific privileges. |

## Creating and Managing Data in PostgreSQL

| Operation               | Command Example |
|--------------------------|-----------------|
| Create Database          | `CREATE DATABASE mydb;` |
| Create Table             | `CREATE TABLE employees (id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, name VARCHAR(100));` |
| Insert Data              | `INSERT INTO employees (name) VALUES ('John Doe');` |
| Update Data              | `UPDATE employees SET name = 'Jane Doe' WHERE id = 1;` |
| Delete Data              | `DELETE FROM employees WHERE id = 1;` |
| Select Data              | `SELECT * FROM employees;` |
| Create Index             | `CREATE INDEX idx_name ON employees (name);` |
| Drop Table               | `DROP TABLE employees;` |
| Drop Database            | `DROP DATABASE mydb;` |
| Create Role/User         | `CREATE ROLE username LOGIN PASSWORD 'password';` |
| Grant Privileges         | `GRANT SELECT, INSERT ON employees TO username;` |

## Installation Steps

For Installation steps follow this document [Click here for Setup and run the PostgresSQL for POC]

## Troubleshooting

|Issue | Solution|
|-------|----------|
|**Connection Refused** | Check postgresql.service status; verify host, port, and credentials|
|**Auth Failure** | Ensure correct username/password; update pg_hba.conf for md5 or scram-sha-256 auth|
|**Database Does Not Exist** | Create it: createdb your_db_name|
|**Port Conflict** | Use lsof -i:5432 to identify conflict or change the port in postgresql.conf|
|**Permission Errors** | Ensure role has appropriate GRANT permissions|

## Conclusion 

PostgreSQL plays a critical role in the OT-MICROSERVICES/attendance-api by offering a reliable, secure, and feature-rich relational database solution. Its support for structured data, complex queries, and seamless integration with Python-based APIs ensures efficient management of attendance records. With PostgreSQL, the project benefits from open-source flexibility, high performance, and long-term scalability.
